    "### Step 5: Complete Project Write Up\n",
    "* Outline of the steps taken in the project:\n",
    "    * Definition of the project scope: Four project questions had to be answered.\n",
    "    * The four given data sets from different areas were examined and aligned with the project questions. Based on these\n",
    "      questions, the data model was built step by step.\n",
    "    * Examination of the data provided important insights. Pandas were used to take a quick look at small data sets to\n",
    "      gain these insights.\n",
    "    * Transformation of the data within the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to build the star schema data model.\n",
    "    * Automatically creation of a data dictionary. The only manual part was to fill the table and column descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The purpose of the final data model is made explicit.\n",
    "    * At the beginning there were 4 project questions that had to be answered. Based on these questions, the data model\n",
    "      was built step by step to the final star data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clearly state the rationale for the choice of tools and technologies for the project.\n",
    "* Used technologies and tools:\n",
    "    * This project uses Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook and Apache Spark (PySpark) in local mode to process 2016 U.S. immigration data.\n",
    "      There are 5 project questions to answer. The ETL pipeline described is always aligned with the questions to be\n",
    "      answered. The data model therefore evolves piece by piece to the final version. The specified tools were selected\n",
    "      because, on the one hand, they are easily suitable for data analysis and preparation. If the requirements become\n",
    "      larger and the amount of data increases, a switch to cloud technologies based on e.g. AWS is possible at any time.\n",
    "      However, this is not the scope of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The write-up describes a logical approach to this project under the following scenarios:\n",
    "* Propose how often the data should be updated and why.\n",
    "    * The ETL process should run on a monthly basis.. This decision was made due to the fact that SAS data is only provided\n",
    "      monthly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a description of how you would approach the problem differently under the following scenarios:\n",
    "    * The data was increased by 100x.\n",
    "        * Source data should be stored in Cloud storage like AWS S3\n",
    "        * To process all data in parallel use clustered Spark nodes (AWS EMR)\n",
    "        * Storing the calculated data in a Star Model data structure within a cloud-based data warehouse (DWH) such as \n",
    "          AWS Redshift, is possible. Optionally, it is also conceivable to store the Star Data Model as Parquet files in \n",
    "          S3 cloud storage for further analysis. \n",
    "        \n",
    "    * The data populates a dashboard that must be updated on a daily basis by 7am every day.\n",
    "        * The I94 source data should be read in daily. This will reduce the amount of data per run. Note that not every\n",
    "          project dataset (e.g. US Cities Demographics or Airport Codes) needs to be loaded daily.\n",
    "        * Apache Airflow could be used for the daily data loading procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The database needed to be accessed by 100+ people.\n",
    "        * Output data should be stored in a cloud DWH such as AWS Redshift to be \"always available\".  In addition, there\n",
    "          is the possibility that the data in the Star data model is made available to the user for self-selection through\n",
    "          self-service BI. Tools such as QlikSense or similar can be used here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "Project-Capstone provides tools to automatically process, clean, analyze US I94 Immigration data in a flexible way and\n",
    "help to answer questions like the four Project questions.\n",
